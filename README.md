# Machine_Learning_Data_Cleanup_Demo
This is a demonstration of how I would clean up data for a machine learning program! The steps include separating the features and labels, splitting the data based on testing and training the model (30% of data becomes the test set), training the classifier, then predicting and evaluating the classifier's accuracy.
